Note a problem is a note-taking app baby!

Until app has been compiled and is installable, easier access by adding

`alias nap='./nap.py'`

in ~/.bashrc


Example uses:
New/Edit note:
    `nap -n note_name`

New note with keywords:
    `nap -n note_name -k keyword1 keyword2`

List available notes
    `nap -l`

Delete a note
    `nap -d note_name`
